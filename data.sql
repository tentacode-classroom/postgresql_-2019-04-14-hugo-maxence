having trouble understanding exactly what do I need to do in this exercise: _"...use eXide to develop a query or set of queries to explore the text you’ve chosen, that is, to extract and format something interesting about the text. Your XQuery should be more interesting and more sophisticated than just a simple XPath to retrieve the value of a single element, but what you find interesting in the text is for you to discover. We would suggest beginning by formulating a question and retrieving the information you need to answer it. Once you’re getting the data you want, try to incorporate your query into a structure that lets you embed the information you’re retrieving inside valid HTML output..."_ How can I make an HTML with XQuery? I thought that this software/method was to find stuff inside an XML or a collection of XMLs.

Compatibility Reportrn- Name of the game with compatibility issues: Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulsern- Steam AppID of the game: 7800rnrn## System Informationrn- GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620 IGPU (Intel Core i7-8550U CPU)rn- Driver/LLVM version: Mesa 18.3.1/6.0.1rn- Kernel version: 4.20rn- Link to full system information report as [Gist](https://gist.github.com/): [report.txt](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/files/2761458/report.txt)rn- Proton version: 3.7-8 (also reproducible with 3.16-4 and 3.16-6 Beta)rnrn## I confirm:rn- [x] that I haven't found an existing compatibility report for this game.rn- [x] that I have checked whether there are updates for my system available.rnrn### `steam-7800.log`rnrn[steam-7800.log](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/files/2761438/steam-7800.log)rnrnNote that I don't upload the complete log because there seems to be an infinite loop or recursive func call, so the log fills up to 75 MB in the first seconds.rnrn```shrn$ grep -c '0008:0009:trace:seh:call_stack_handlers calling handler at 0x7bc805f0 code=c0000005 flags=10'

file is too heavy. If you still need the complete log, I will reupload it.rnrn## SymptomsrnrnAfter the game is started, the screen remains black, the game doesn't respond to key/mousepress, after a while Gnome suggests to force quit the app.rnrnrn## ReproductionrnrnStart the game, sit back, watch."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/comments/482901383","html_url":"https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/2221#issuecomment-482901383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/2221","id":482901383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjkwMTM4Mw==","user":{"login":"hoefling","id":4455652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTU2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4455652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling","html_url":"https://github.com/hoefling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hoefling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-14T00:00:04Z","updated_at":"2019-04-14T00:00:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Another
